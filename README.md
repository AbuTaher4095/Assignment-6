1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
    var → can change, not safe.
    let → can change, safer.
    const → cannot change, fixed.
2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
    map() → makes a new array after changing each item.
    forEach() → just runs code on each item, no new array.
    filter() → makes a new array with only matching items.
3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
    Arrow functions are a short way to write functions in ES6.
    Example of arrow function:
    const add = (a, b) => a + b; this is arrow function in ES6.
5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
    Template literals in ES6 are special strings written with backticks (` `).
    Easily add variables inside strings with ${ }
    such as:
    let addName = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
    Difference:
    Concatenation = Joining with plus operator and adding strings with + operator.
    Template literals = cleaner, support variables & multi-line easily
